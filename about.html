      <h1>About the University</h1>
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      The Takoradi Technical University was established in September, 2016, as a
      result of the government’s policy to convert Takoradi Polytechnic, among
      five other Polytechnics, to the status of Technical University. In effect,
      since April 1954, Takoradi Technical University (formerly Takoradi
      Polytechnic) has existed as a Government Technical Institute under the
      Ghana Education Service of the Ministry of Education. During that period,
      the institute offered programmes mainly at the Craft and Technician
      Certificate levels in commercial and technical subjects, awarding Royal
      Society of Arts (RSA) and City and Guilds of London, United Kingdom.
      However, in 1990, the Ghana Education Service took over the awards of the
      above-mentioned certificates. As part of the Ghana Educational Reforms
      which began in the 1980s, the Takoradi Technical Institute and five other
      similar institutions were upgraded by the Polytechnic Act 321 (PNDC Law
      1993) to become part of the Ghana Tertiary Education System. The
      Polytechnics, per the law, began to offer Higher National Diploma (HND)
      programmers in the 1993/1994 academic year. These reforms mandated the
      polytechnics to compliment the role of the Universities to increase access
      to tertiary education for the training of middle and higher-level
      manpower.

      <p>
        A Bill proposed by the Ministry of Education and considered by Cabinet
        of Government in 2014 was passed by Parliament as an Act in August 2016
        with the assent of the President, converting some polytechnics into
        technical universities as full-fledged technical universities. In view
        of that, the Takoradi Polytechnic Council adopted the name “Takoradi
        Technical University” which has been duly registered with the Registrar
        General’s Department of Ghana. Currently, Takoradi Technical University
        has three (3) campuses: Effia Kuma (Takoradi), Butumagyebu (Sekondi) and
        Akatakyi (Agona-Nkwanta). The Akatakyi Campus is the largest of the
        three, with an acreage of 152.3.
